### I know there are lots of apps that are more efficient and easy to use. But I created this as a hobby project. You can create a Server and Client to communicate. The Server is made with [JAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and client made with [GOLANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))
